    <p id="about">These delicious cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever.<br><br>Pat Paxton founded the Pat's Cookies Company in Seattle, Washington in the year 2012. He got his idea when as a kid he enjoyed the shape and texture of animal crackers. So Pat wanted to create a snack unique and representative of the Pacific Northwest cuisine and culture. As of 2018, Pat's Cookies has locations in Everton, Bellvue, Redmond, Tacoma, and Vancouver and is looking to open a new branch in Portland, Oregon. </p>
