        <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
        <img src="salmon.png" alt="salmon fish"/>
        <p>These delicious cookies are made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. Or gray Seattle afternoon... whatever.</p>
